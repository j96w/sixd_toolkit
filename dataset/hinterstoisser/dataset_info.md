# SIXD DATASET: Hinterstoisser et al. [1] with extra ground truth from
Brachmann et al. [2]


## Dataset parameters

* Objects: 15
* Object models: Mesh models with surface color and normals.
* Training images: 19695 rendered images (1313 per object)
* Test images: 18273
* Distribution of the ground truth poses in test images:
    * Range of object distances: 601 - 1102 mm if only the original ground
        truth is considered, and 346 - 1500 mm if also the extra ground truth
        from [2] is considered.
    * Azimuth range: 0 - 360 deg
    * Elevation range: 3 - 90 deg


## Training images

The training images were obtained by rendering of the object models from a
densely sampled view sphere with the radius of 400 mm (there are only 3 object
occurrences in the test images closer than 400 mm) and the elevation range of
0 - 90 deg (i.e. views from the upper hemisphere).

Note that in [1] the object models were rendered at multiple distances (using
view spheres of multiple radii).

One can use this script to render more training images:

## Extra ground truth

Brachmann et al. [2] provided extra ground truth poses for the Benchvise test
sequence, which is scene 2 in the new format. The extra ground truth is included
in test/02/gt.yml together with the ground truth poses for Benchvise.
